# Coffee-Bean-sales-analysis
<br>
I'm excited to share my latest project where I explored Coffee Bean Sales Trends across Saudi Arabia using SQL! The project analyzed 2 years of sales data from 100 customers, covering 5 different coffee bean types.
<br>
💡 Key Objectives: ✅ Analyzed monthly and daily sales trends to identify peak sales periods. <br>
 ✅ Measured the impact of discounts on revenue and customer preferences. <br>
 ✅ Compared average order quantities across different coffee types. <br>
 ✅ Ranked cities and products based on total sales to optimize marketing efforts. <br>

📊 Key Insights: 🔹 Brazilian and Ethiopian coffee beans topped the charts for average order quantities. <br>
 🔹 Maximum sales occurred on Wednesdays, while Saturdays recorded the lowest orders. <br>
 🔹 Discounts significantly boosted order volumes. <br>

🔎 SQL Techniques Used: 👉 Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) <br>
 👉 Window functions (RANK(), ROW_NUMBER())<br>
 👉 Joins, Subqueries & Date-Time functions to derive deep insights.<br>

🚀 Takeaways: This project strengthened my SQL data analysis skills and provided valuable insights into customer behavior and sales trends.
